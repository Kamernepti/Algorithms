    <h1>Testing Algorithms</h1>
    <h2><u>Fundamentals</u></h2>
    <h3>Setting and Swapping</h3>
    <p>Set myNum to 42. Set myName to your name. Now swap myNum and myName.</p>

    <h3>Print -52 to 1066</h3>
    <p>Print integers from -52 to 1066 using a FOR loop</p>

    <h3>Don't Worry, Be Happy</h3>
    <p>Create beCheerful(). Within it, console.log string "good morning!" Call it 98 times.</p>

    <h3>Multiples of Three- but Not All</h3>
    <p>Using a for loop, print multiples of 3 from -300 to 0. skip -3 and -6.</p>

    <h3>Printing Itegers with While</h3>
    <p>Print integers from 2000 to 5280, using a while loop</p>

    <h3>You Say It's Your Birthday</h3>
    <p>If 2 given numbers represent your birth month and day in either order, log "How did you know?", else log "Just another day..."</p>

    <h3>Print and Count</h3>
    <p>Print all integer multiples of 5, from 512 to 4096. afterwards, log how many there were. </p>

    <h3>Multiples of Six</h3>
    <p>Print multiples of 6 up to 60,000, using a While Loop</p>

    <h3>Counting, the Dojo Way</h3>
    <p>Print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, print "coding" instead. If by 10, also print "dojo"</p>

    <h3>What do you know?</h3>
    <p>Your function will be given an input parameter "incoming". console.log this value.</p>

    <h3>Whoa, That Sucker's Huge</h3>
    <p>Add odd integers from -300,000 to 300,000, and console.log the final sum. is there a shortcut?</p>

    <h3>Countdown by Fours</h3>
    <p>Log positive numbers starting at 2016, counting down by fours (exclude 0), witout a for loop.</p>

    <h3>Leap Year</h3>
    <p>Write a function that determines whether a given year is a leap year. If a year is divisible by four, it is a leap year, unless it is divisible by 100. However, if it is divisible by 400 then it is.</p>

    <h3>Flexible Counting</h3>
    <p>Based on the earlier "countdown by fours", given lowNum, highNum, mult, print multiples of mult from highNum dow to lowNum, using a for loop. </p>
    
    <h3>The Final Countdown</h3>
    <p>Based on flexible countdown. the parameter names are not as helpful, but the problem is identical. given 4 parameters(param1, param2, param3, param4), print multiples of param1, starting at 
        param2 and extending to param3.
        one exception, if the multiples equal param4, then skip it. do this using a while loop.</p>

    <h3>Countdown</h3>
    <p>Create a function that accepts a number as an input. Return a new array that counts down by one, from
    the number (as array’s ‘zeroth’ element) down to 0 (as the last element). How long is this array?</p>
    
    <h3>Print and Return</h3>
    <p>Your function will receive an array with two numbers. Print the first value, and return the second.</p>
    
    <h3>First Plus Length</h3>
    <p>Given an array, return the sum of the first value in the array, plus the array’s length. What happens if the 
    array’s first value is not a number, but a string (like "what?") or a boolean (like false).</p>

    <h3>Values Greater than Second</h3>
    <p>For [1,3,5,7,9,13], print values that are greater than its 2nd value. Return how many values this is.</p>

    <h3>This Length That Value</h3>
    <p>Given two numbers, return array of length num1 with each value num2.  Print "Jinx!" if they are the same.</p>

    <h3>Fit the first value</h3>
    <p>the function should accept an array.  If value at [0] is greater than array's length, print "Too Big!".</p>
    <p>if value at [0] is less than array's length, print "too small!".  otherwise, print "Just right!"</p>

    <h3>Celsius to Fahrenheit </h3>
    <p>Create celsiusToFahrenheit (cDegrees) that accepts number of degrees Celsius, and returns the equivalent temperature expressed in Fahrenheit degrees.</p>


    <br>
    <h2><u>Basic Fundamentals</u></h2>
    <h3>Biggie Size</h3>
    <p>Given an array, write a function that changes all positive numbers in the array to “big”. Example: makeItBig([-1,3,5,-5]) returns that same array, changed to [-1,"big","big",-5].</p>

    <h3>Print Low, Return High</h3>
    <p>Create a function that takes an array of numbers. The function should print the lowest value in the array, and return the highest value in the array.</p>

    <h3>Print One, Return Another</h3>
    <p>Build a function that takes an array of numbers. The function should print the second-to-last value in the array, and return first odd value in the array.</p>

    <h3>Double Vision</h3>
    <p>Given an array, create a function to return a new array where each value in the original has been doubled. Calling double([1,2,3]) should return [2,4,6] without changing original.</p>

    <h3>Count Positives</h3>
    <p>Given an array of numbers, create a function to replace last value with the number of positive values. Example,  countPositives([-1,1,1,1]) changes array to [-1,1,1,3] and returns it.</p>

    <h3>Evens and Odds</h3>
    <p>Create a function that accepts an array. Every time that array has three odd values in a row, print "That’s odd!" Every time the array has three evens in a row, print "Even more so!"</p>

    <h3>Increment the Seconds</h3>
    <p>Given arr, add 1 to odd elements ([1], [3], etc.), console.log all values and return arr</p>

    <h3>Previous Lengths</h3>
    <p>You are passed an array containing strings. Working within that same array, replace each string with a number – the length of the string at previous array index – and return the array.</p>

    <h3>Add Seven to Most</h3>
    <p>Build a function that accepts an array. Return a new array with all values except first, adding 7 to each. Do not alter the original array.</p>
    
    <h3>Reverse Array</h3>
    <p>Given array, write a function to reverse values, in-place. Example: reverse([3,1,6,4,2]) returns same array, containing [2,4,6,1,3].</p>

    <h3>Outlook:Negative</h3>
    <p>Given an array, create and return a new one containing all the values of the provided array, made negative (not simply multiplied by -1). Given [1,-3,5], return [-1,-3,-5].</p>

    <h3>Always Hungary</h3>
    <p>Create a function that accepts an array, and prints "yummy" each time one of the values is equal to "food". If no array elements are
        "food", then print "I'm hungry" once.</p>

    <h3>Swap Toward the Center</h3>
    <p>Given array, swap first and last, third and third-tolast, etc. Input[true,42,"Ada",2,"pizza"] becomes ["pizza",42,"Ada",2,true]. 
        Change [1,2,3,4,5,6] to [6,2,4,3,5,1].</p>

    <h3>Scale the Array</h3>
    <p>Given array arr and number num, multiply each arr value by num, and return the changed arr.</p>

    <h3>Only Keep the Last Few</h3>
    <p>Stan learned something today: that directly decrementing an array’s .length immediately shortens it by that amount. Given array arr and number X, remove all except the last X elements, and return 
        arr (changed and shorter). Given ([2,4,6,8,10],3), change the given array to [6,8,10] and return it.</p>

    <h3>Math Help</h3>
    <p>Cartman doesn’t really like math; he needs help. You are given two numbers – coefficients M and B in the equation Y = MX + B. Build a function to return the X-intercept (his older cousin Fiaz wisely 
        reminds him that X-intercept is the value of X where Y equals zero; Cartman just snorts in his general direction).</p>

    <h3>Poor Kenny</h3>
    <p>Kenny tries to stay safe, but somehow everyday something happens. Out of the last 100 days, there were 10 days with volcanos, 15 others with tsunamis, 20 earthquakes, 25 blizzards and 30 meteors 
        (for 100 days total). If these probabilities continue, write whatHappensToday() to print a day’s outcome.</p>

    <h3>What Really Happened?</h3>
    <p>Kyle (smarter than Kenny) notes that the chance of one disaster should be unrelated to the chance of another. Change whatHappensToday() function to create whatReallyHappensToday(). In this new function 
        test for each disaster independently, instead of assuming exactly one disaster will happen. In other words, with this new function, all five might occur today – or none. Maybe Kenny will survive!</p>

    <h3>Soaring IQ</h3>
    <p>Your time at the Dojo will definitely make you smarter! Let’s say a new Dojo student, Bogdan entered with a modest IQ of 101. Let’s say that during a 14-week bootcamp, his IQ rose by .01 on the first 
        day, then went up by an additional .02 on the second day, then up by .03 more on the third day, etc. all the way until increasing by .98 on his 98th day (the end of 14 full weeks). What is Bogdan’s 
        final IQ?</p>

    <h3>Letter Grade</h3>
    <p>Mr. Cerise teaches high school math. Write a function that assigns and prints a letter grade, given an integer representing a score from 0 to 100? Those getting 90+ get an ‘A’, 80-89 earn ‘B’, 70-79 is 
        a ‘C’, 60-69 should get a ‘D’, and lower than 60 receive ‘F’. For example, given 88, you should log "Score: 88. Grade: B". Given the score 61, log the string "Score: 61. Grade: D".</p>

    <h3>More Accurate Grades</h3>
    <p>For an additional challenge, add ‘-’ signs to scores in the bottom two percent of A, B, C and D scores, and “+” signs to the top two percent of B, C and D scores (sorry, Mr. Cerise never gives an A+). 
        Given 88, console.log "Score: 88. Grade: B+". Given 61, log "Score: 61. Grade: D-" .</p>

    <br>
    <h2><u> Fundamentals II</u></h2>

    <h3>Sigma</h3>
    <p>Implement function sigma(num) that given a number, returns the sum of all positive integers up to number (inclusive). Ex.: sigma(3) = 6 (or 1 + 2 + 3); sigma(5) = 15 (or 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5).</p>

    <h3>Factorial</h3>
    <p>Just the Facts, ma’am. Factorials, that is. Write a function factorial(num) that, given a number, returns the product (multiplication) of all positive integers from 1 up to number (inclusive). 

        For example, factorial(3) = 6 (or 1 * 2 * 3); factorial(5) = 120 (or 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5).</p>

    <h3>Star Art</h3>
    <p>Assume that you have a text field that is exactly 75 characters long. You want to fill it with spaces and asterisks ('*'), sometimes called stars. You should print the given number of asterisks 
        consecutively. Depending on which function is called, those stars should be left-justified (the first star would be very first char in the text field), or right-justified (the last star would 
        be very last char in the text field, with potentially some number of spaces at beginning of text field before the block of stars start), or centered in the 75-
        character text field (with the same number of spaces on either side of the block of stars, plus/minus one).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Write a function drawLeftStars(num) that accepts a number and prints that many asterisks.</li>
            <li>Write a function drawRightStars(num) that prints 75 characters total. Stars should build from the right side. The last num characters should be asterisks; the other 75 should be spaces.</li>
            <li>Write function drawCenteredStars(num) that prints 75 characters total. The stars should be centered in the 75. The middle num characters should be asterisks; the rest of the 75 spaces.</li>
            <li> (Optional) Create epic text-art Empire vs. Rebellion battle scenes, with ships like (=*=)and >o<.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Character Art</h3>
    <p>From the above, derive the following that accepts and draws the given characters, not just asterisks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> drawLeftChars(num,char)</li>
            <li>drawRightChars(num,char)</li>
            <li>drawCenteredChars(num,char)</li>
            <li>For all three of these, you can safely assume that 'char'is a string with the length of 1.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Threes and Fives</h3>
        <p>Create threesFives() that adds values from 100 and 4000000 (inclusive) if that value is evenly divisible by 3 or 5 but not both. Display the final sum in the console.</p>
        <p>Second: Create betterThreesFives(start, end) that allows you to enter arbitrary start and end values for your range. Think of threesFives() as betterThreesFives(100,4000000).</p>

        <h3>Generate Coin Change</h3>
        <p>Change is inevitable (especially when breaking a twenty). Make generateCoinChange(cents). Accept a number of American cents, compute and print how to represent that amount with the smallest 
            number of coins. Common American coins are pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents), dimes (10 cents), and quarters (25 cents).</p>
        <p>Example output, given (94):</p>
        <p>94 cents can be represented by:
            quarters: 3
            dimes: 1
            nickels: 1
            pennies: 4</p>
        <p>Second: can you simplify/shorten your code?</p>
        <p>Third: add half-dollar (50 cents) and dollar (100 cents) coins with 40 additional characters or less.</p>

        <h3>Messy Math Mashup</h3>
        <p>Create a function messyMath(num) that will return the following sum: add all integers from 0 up to the given num, except for the following special cases of our count value:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If current count (not num) is evenly divisible by 3, don’t add to the sum; skip to the next count;</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if the current count is evenly divisible by 7, include it twice in sum instead of once;</li>
            <li>Regardless of the above, if the current count is exactly 1/3 of num, return -1 immediately.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For example, if given num is 4, return 7. If given num is 8, return 34. If given num is 15, return -1.</p>

        <h3>Twelve-Bar Blues</h3>
        <p>Write a function that console.logs the number 1, then "chick", then "boom", then "chick", then 2, then "chick", "boom", "chick" – continuing the same cycle for each number up to (including) 12.</p>

        <h3>Fibonacci</h3>
        <p>Create a function to generate Fibonacci numbers. In this famous mathematical sequence, each number is the sum of the previous two, starting with values 0 and 1. Your function should accept one 
            argument, an index into the sequence (where 0 corresponds to the initial value, 4 corresponds to the value four later, etc). </p>
        <p>Examples: fibonacci(0) = 0 (given), fibonacci(1) = 1 (given), fibonacci(2) = 1 (fib(0)+fib(1), or 0+1), fibonacci(3) = 2 (fib(1)+fib(2), or 1+1), fibonacci(4) = 3 (1+2), fibonacci(5) = 5 (2+3), 
            fibonacci(6) = 8 (3+5), fibonacci(7) = 13 (5+8), etc.</p>

        <h3>Sum to One Digit</h3>
        <p>Kaitlin sees beauty in numbers, but also believes that less is more. Implement sumToOne(num) that sums a given integer’s digits repeatedly until the sum is only one digit. Return that one-digit result. </p>
        <p>Example: sumToOne(928) returns 1, because 9+2+8 = 19, then 1+9 = 10, then 1+0 = 1.</p>

        <h3>Clock Hand Angels</h3>
        <p>Regardless of how hard a Dojo student works (and they should work hard), they need time now and then to unwind – like hands on a clock. Traditional clocks are increasingly uncommon, but most can still 
            read an analog clock’s hands of hours, minutes and seconds. Create clockHandAngles(seconds) that, given a number of seconds since 12:00:00, prints angles (in degrees) of the hour, minute and second 
            hands. As a review, 360 degrees form a full rotation. For input of 3600 secs (equivalent to 1:00:00), print "Hour hand: 30 degs. Minute hand: 0 degs. Second hand: 0 degs." For an input parameter seconds 
            of 119730 (which is equivalent to 9:15:30 plus 24 hours!), you should log "Hour hand: 277.745 degs. Minute hand: 93 degs. Second hand: 180 degs." </p>
        <p>Note: in the second example, the angle for the minute hand is not simply 90 degrees; it has advanced a bit further, because of the additional 30 seconds in that minute so far.</p>
        <p>Second: also calculate and print degrees for an additional “week hand” that rotates once each week.</p>

        <h3>Is Prime</h3>
        <p>Return whether a given integer is prime.  Prime numbers are only even divisible by themselves and 1.  Many highly optimized solutions exist, but for now, just create one that is easy to understand and debug</p>

        <h3>Extract-o-Matic</h3>
        <p>Create the extractDigit(num,digitNum) function that given a number and a digit number, returns the numeral value of that digit. 0 represents the ones digit, 1 represents the tens digit, etc. Given (1824,2), return 8. Given (1824,0), return 4. Given (1824,7), return 0.</p>
        <p>Second: handle negative digitNum values, where -1 represents tenths digit (0.x), -2 represents hundredths digit (0.0x), etc. Given (123.45,-1), return 4.</p>
        <p>Third: handle negative num values as well, doing what you think is appropriate.</p>

        <h3>Most Significant Digit</h3>
        <p>If you already know who Ada Lovelace is, that’s great! In a History of Science, she is significant. Given a number of any size, return the most significant digit. If you already know what strings are, that’s great! However, don’t use them here :-). </p>
        <p>Hint: use WHILE to bring the most significant digit into a range where you can use the friendly modulus operator (%). The most significant digit is the leftmost non-zero digit of a number. Given 12345, return 1. Given 67.89, return 6. Given 0.00987, return 9.</p>
        <p>Second: handle negative num values as well, doing what you think is appropriate.</p>

        <h3>Gaming Fun(damentals)</h3>
        <p>It’s New Year’s Eve, so let’s play some dice games! It’ll be fun. What could go wrong?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create function rollOne() to return a randomly selected integer between 1 and 6 (inclusive).   </li>
            <li>Second, create a function playFives(num), which should call rollOne() multiple times –  ‘num' times, in fact, where 'num' is input parameter to playFives(num). 
                Each time, it should print the value rollOne() returns, and if that return value is 5, also print “That’s good luck!”</li>
            <li>Third, create a new function named playStatistics(), which should call rollOne() eight times (but not print anything after each call). After the last of these 
                eight calls, it should print out the lowest and highest values that it received from rollOne, among those eight calls.</li>
            <li>Fourth, make a copy of playStatistics and add code to make playStatistics2(), so that at the end (in addition to printing high/low rolls), it also prints the 
                total sum of all eight rolls.</li>
            <li>Fifth, copy playStatistics2 and add code to it to make playStatistics3(num), so that it will roll as many times as you want, instead of always doing this 
                eight times.</li>
            <li>Finally, make a copy of playStatistics3 and change it to create playStatistics4(num), so that at the end instead of the total sum, it prints the average roll.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Statistics Until Doubles</h3>
        <p>Here’s another game for our New Year’s Eve party. Implement a ’20-sided die’ that randomly returns integers between 1 and 20 inclusive. Roll these, tracking statistics 
            until you get a value twice in a row. Display number of rolls, min, max, and average.</p>
        
        <h3>Claire is Where?</h3>
        <p>On New Year’s Eve, have fun but don’t forget your way home! For this challenge create four functions (reset, moveBy, xLocation and yLocation) to track the travels of 
            Claire, a wanderer. Calling reset() moves Claire home to the origin (0,0).</p>
        <p>The moveBy(xOffset,yOffset) function moves her by those amounts, in those directions. Finally, xLocation() and yLocation()return how far Claire is from home, 
            in X and Y directions respectively. After the calls of reset(), moveBy(1,-2), and moveBy(3,1), subsequently calling xLocation() and yLocation() should return 4 and -1.</p>
        <p>Second: create distFromHome(). Assuming she moves diagonally, return her distance from home.</p>

        <h3>Date, on a Deserted Island</h3>
        <p>After a particularly fabulous New Year’s Eve party to end 2016, Eduardo wakes to find himself stranded on a deserted island. He misses his home in Burbank, but at least 
            now he can spend plenty of time outdoors – and you can’t beat the commute! To pass the time until he is rescued, he counts sunrises.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Help Eduardo track what day of the week it is. Create a weekdayName(weekdayNum) function that, given a number between 1 and 7, will console.log a string containing the day of 
                the week for that number (given 1, log "Sunday"). Use a SWITCH statement.</li>
            <li>Expand weekdayName() to create weekdayName2(dayNum) accepting numbers up to 365. Return weekday as before, given number of days total. "Sunday" still corresponds to 1.</li>
            <li>Create a new function someDays() that calls weekDayName2() seventeen times, with randomly generated integers as high as 365. Log each result string. If it is a weekday, add 
                the phrase "Work hard!", and if it is a weekend day, add "Enjoy your day off!"</li>
            <li>Build function monthName(monthNum) that, given a number from 1 to 12, returns a string containing month for that number ("May" corresponds to 5). Use an array, without loops.</li>
            <li>Now expand monthName() to create monthToDays(monthNum), returning the number of days in that month, in the year 2017. Hint: use a SWITCH statement for the days in each month.</li>
            <li>Despite using his ember expertise to create a glowing SOS visible from space, the days go by and sadly Eduardo is still not rescued. Is it spring yet? It might as well be. 
                Build on monthName() to create dayToMonth(dayNum). If given a day number since the year began, return the current month (assume it is not a Leap Year). Given 75, return "March".</li>
            <li>Eduardo builds a Dojo bootcamp on the island. Initially his students only find Ninja Gold in caves, but eventually, even his tree sloths can write code quickly! Dojo classes 
                meet Monday thru Friday, so let’s reincorporate weekday to our calculations.  Construct fullDate(dayNum) to accept the number of days so far in 2017, and return a full date 
                string. He hardly remembers that fateful New Year’s Eve party, but he knows it was a Saturday. Given 142, return "Monday, May 22, 2017".</li>
            <li>Times flies when you’re at a Dojo – months in fact. Build fullDate2(dayNum) that will be given a 4-digit integer: the days that have passed since December 31, 2016. This number 
                can stretch into future years! You can assume that any year number divisible by four is a leap year and has a 29- day February. Given 8475, return "Thursday, March 15, 2040".</li>
            <li>Eduardo hacks the Google Maps API and adds this long-forgotten island back onto the map. Soon he is rescued! News of his Hemingway-like stoicism make him famous for centuries. 
                Build fullDate3(dayNum) to handle days up to 140,000! Note: years 2100, 2200, and 2300 are not leap years (although 2400 is). Given 139947, return "Tuesday, February 29, 2400".</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Having completed this epic saga, you are ready for additional concepts and chapters! Journey safely….</p>

    <p>Given an array and an additional value, insert this value at the beginning of the array. Do this without using any built-in array methods.</p>

    <h3>Pop Front</h3>
    <p>Given an array, remove and return the value at the beginning of the array. Do this without using any built-in array methods except pop().</p>

    <h3>Insert At</h3>
    <p>Given an array, index, and additional value, insert the value into array at given index. Do this without using built-in array methods. You can think of pushFront(arr,val) as equivalent to insertAt(arr,0,val).</p>

    <h3>Remove at</h3>
    <p>Given an array and an index into array, remove and return the array value at that index. Do this without using built-in array methods except pop(). Think of popFront(arr) as equivalent to removeAt(arr,0).</p>

    <h3>Swap Pairs</h3>
    <p>Swap positions of successive pairs of values of given array. If length is odd, do not change the final element. For [1,2,3,4], return [2,1,4,3]. For example, change input ["Brendan",true,42] to [true,"Brendan",42]. As with all array challenges, do this without using any built-in array methods.</p>

    <h3>Remove Duplicates**********************</h3>
    <p>Sara is looking to hire an awesome web developer and has received applications from various sources. Her assistant alphabetized them but noticed some duplicates. Given a sorted array, remove duplicate values. Because array elements are already in order, all duplicate values will be grouped together. As with all these array challenges, do this without using any built-in array methods.</p>
    <p>Second: Solve this without using any nested loops.</p>

    <h3>Min to Front **************************</h3>
    <p>Given an array of comparable values, move the lowest element to array’s front, shifting backward any elements previously ahead of it. Do not otherwise change the array’s order. Given [4,2,1,3,5], change it to [1,4,2,3,5] and return it. As always, do this without using built-in functions.</p>

    <h3>Remove Negatives ************************</h3>
    <p>Implement removeNegatives() that accepts an array, removes negative values, and returns the same array (not a copy), preserving non-negatives’ order. As always, do not use built-in array functions.</p>

    <h3>Second-to-Last</h3>
    <p>Return the second-to-last element of an array. Given [42,true,4,"Kate",7], return "Kate". If array is too short, return null.</p>

    <h3>Second-Largest</h3>
    <p>Return the second-largest element of an array. Given [42,1,4,Math.PI,7], return 7. If the array is too short, return null.</p>





    
    <h3>Nth-to-Last</h3>
    <p>Return the element that is N-from-array’s-end. Given ([5,2,3,6,4,9,7],3), return 4. If the array is too short, return null.</p>

    <h3>Nth-Largest</h3>
    <p>Liam has "N" number of Green Belt stickers for excellent Python projects. Given arr and N, return the Nth-largest element, where (N-1) elements are larger. Return null if needed.</p>
    
    <h3>Skyline Heights</h3>
    <p>Lovely Burbank has a breathtaking view of the Los Angeles skyline. Let’s say you are given an array with heights of consecutive buildings, starting closest to you and extending away. Array [-1,7,3] would represent three buildings: first is actually out of view below street level, behind it is second at 7 stories high, third is 3 stories high (hidden behind the 7-story). You are situated at street level. Return array containing heights of buildings you can see, in order. Given [-1,1,1,7,3] return [1,7]. Given [0,4] return [4]. As always with challenges, do not use built-in array functions such as unshift().</p>

    <h3>Credit Card Validation</h3>
    <p>The Luhn formula is sometimes used to validate credit card numbers. Create the function isCreditCardValid(digitArr) that accepts an array of digits on the card (13-19 depending on the card), and returns a boolean whether the card digits satisfy the Luhn formula, as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Set aside the last digit; do not include it in these calculations (until step 5);</li>
        <li>Starting from the back, multiply the digits in odd positions (last, third-to-last, etc.) by 2;</li>
        <li>If any results are larger than 9, subtract 9 from them;</li>
        <li>Add all numbers (not just our odds) together;</li>
        <li>Now add the last digit back in – the sum should be a multiple of 10.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For example, when given digit array [5,2,2,8,2], after step 1) it becomes [5,2,2,8], then after step 2) it is [5,4,2,16]. Post-3) we have [5,4,2,7], then following 4) it becomes 18. After step 5) our value is 20, so ultimately we return true. If the final digit were any non-multiple-of-10, we would instead return false.</p>

    <h3>Shuffle</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, the Array object has numerous useful methods. It does not, however, contain a method that will randomize the order of an array’s elements. Let’s create shuffle(arr), to efficiently shuffle a given array’s values. Work in-place, naturally. Do you need to return anything from your function?</p>

    <h3>Remove Range</h3>
    <p>Given array, and indices start and end, remove vals in that index range, working in-place (hence shortening the array). Given ([20,30,40,50,60,70],2,4), change to [20,30,70] and return it.</p>

    <h3>Intermediate Sums</h3>
    <p>You will be given an array of numbers. After every tenth element, add an additional element containing the sum of those ten values. If the array does not end aligned evenly with ten elements, add one last sum that includes those last elements not yet been included in one of the earlier sums. Given the array [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2], change it to [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,15,1,2,1,2,6].</p>

    <h3>Double Trouble</h3>
    <p>Create a function that changes a given array to list each original element twice, retaining original order. Convert [4,"Ulysses",42,false] to [4,4,"Ulysses","Ulysses",42,42,false,false].</p>

    <h3>Zip It</h3>
    <p>Create a standalone function that accepts two arrays and combines their values sequentially into a new array, at alternating indices starting with first array. Extra values from either array should be included afterward. Given [1,2] and [10,20,30,40], return new array containing [1,10,2,20,30,40].</p>
    <p>Second: combine the two arrays’ values into the first array, instead of into a new array. Much more fun!</p>

    <h3>Average (Warmup)</h3>
    <p>(Warm-up) Always run through some quick algorithm problems before any coding interview, to get yourself warmed up. How about this one: return the average value of an array of unsorted numbers.</p>

    <h3>Balance Point</h3>
    <p>Write a function that returns whether the given array has a balance point between indices, where one side’s sum is equal to the other’s. Example: [1,2,3,4,10] → true (between indices 3 & 4), but [1,2,4,2,1] → false.</p>

    <h3>Balance Index</h3>
    <p>Here, a balance point is on an index, not between indices. Return the balance index where sums are equal on either side (exclude its own value). Return -1 if none exist. Ex.: [-2,5,7,0,3] → 2, but [9,9] → -1.</p>

    <h3>Taco Truck</h3>
    <p>Joe drives a taco truck in the booming town of Squaresburg. He uses an array of [x,y] coordinates corresponding to locations of his customers. They walk to his truck, but he is fair-minded so he wants to minimize total distance from truck to customers. City blocks are perfect squares, and every street is two-way, at perfect right angles. He only parks by street corners (coordinates like [37,-16]). Customers only travel on streets: coordinate [2,-2] is distance 4 from [0,0]. Joe checks the array before deciding where to park. Given a customer coordinate array, return an optimal taco truck location. Example: given [ [10,0], [-1,-10], [2,4] ], return [2,0], as total distance is 25 (8+13+4).</p>

    <h3>Array: Binary Search</h3>
    <p>Given a sorted array and a value, return whether the array contains that value. Do not sequentially iterate the array. Instead, ‘divide and conquer’, taking advantage of the fact that the array is sorted. As always, only use built-in functions that you are prepared to recreate (write yourself) on demand!</p>

    <h3>Min of Sorted-Rotated</h3>
    <p>You will be given a numerical array that has first been sorted, then rotated by an unknown amount. Find and return the minimum value in that array. Don’t use built-in functions (surprise!). </p>
    <p>Given the input array ["Gigli","Jay is  cool","Mavis","Phoebe","Thurber","Anna","Celeste","Elon"], you should return "Anna". Remember, do not linearly iterate the array!</p>

    <h3>String:Binary Search</h3>
    <p>You will be given a very long string and a single character. Return whether that character is present in the string. Note: the characters in the string have been arranged so that the charCodeAt() values for each character are monotonically ascending from the beginning of the string to the back. Use the fact that the string is effectively sorted. Don’t use built-in functions. Note: characters may not be exactly as you might have considered ‘alphabetized’, but char.charCodeAt() works well. </p>
    <p>Example: if your function is given the inputs (" &-0379DEFXZ[abcz|", "6"), it should return false. If instead it is sent (" &-0379DEFXZ[abcz|", "c"), return true. Remember, don’t iterate the string linearly!</p>

    <h3>Flatten</h3>
    <p>Flatten a given array, eliminating nested and empty arrays. Do not alter it; return a new one retaining order. For [1,[2,3],4,[]] return [1,2,3,4].</p>
    <p>Second: work ‘in-place’ in the given array (do not create another). Alter order if needed. Ex.: [1,[2,3],4,[]] could become [1,3,4,2].</p>
    <p>Third: make your algorithm both in-place and stable. Do you need a return value?</p>

    <h3>Remove Duplicates</h3>
    <p>Remove array duplicates. Do not alter original. Return new array with results ‘stable’ (original order). For [1,2,1,3,4,2] return [1,2,3,4].</p>
    <p>Second: work ‘in-place’ in given array. Alter order if needed (stability is not required). Ex.: [1,2,1,3,4,2] could become [1,2,4,3].</p>
    <p>Third: make it in-place and stable.</p>
    <p>Fourth: eliminate any second (inner) loop.</p>

    <h3>Mode</h3>
    <p>Back in the Basic 13, you wrote code to compute an array’s minimum and maximum values. You also wrote code to determine the average value (the “mean”). What about the “mode” – the most common value in that data set. Create a function that, given an array, returns the most frequent value in the array.</p>
    <p>Second: memory constraints prevent your using a new array. How does this affect your solution?</p>

    <h3>Buffer Copy</h3>
    <p>Create arrBufferCopy(sourceArr,destArr,sourceStartIdx,destStartIdx,numVals) to copy numVals values starting at sourceArr[sourceStartIdx] to destArr[destStartIdx] etc. Do not lengthen destArr, nor read off the end of sourceArr.</p>
    <p>Second: if you reach either array’s end, wraparound to continue writing/reading at beginning of array.</p>
    <p>Third: if numVals > destArr.length, only copy the minimum needed amount.</p>
    <p>Fourth: sourceArr can now be the same array as destArr! Only handle the non-wrap case. That is, you can assume that you won’t need to read beyond arr.length. You can extend the array on writes.</p>
    <p>Fifth: if you made it this far, good job! Now for a real challenge: handle all possible cases where sourceArr and destArr are the same array, including wraparound, not overwriting original array data prematurely, nor extending it, but copying all data in-place. If arr.length is 100, how would you handle significant wraparound and overwriting, such as arrBufferCopy(arr,arr,30,80,95)?</p>

    <h3>Smarter Sum</h3>
    <p>Use time-space tradeoff to accelerate average running time for iSigma(num) that returns sum of integers from 1 to num. Recall iSigma(1)=1, iSigma(2)=3, iSigma(3)=6, iSigma(4)=10.</p>

    <h3>Faster Factorial</h3>
    <p>Remember Factorial(num)? It returned the product of positive integers from 1 to num. Examples: Factorial(1) = 1, Factorial(2) = 2, Factorial(3) = 6. For these purposes, Factorial(0) = 1. Recreate this function, but use a time-space tradeoff to accelerate the average running time.</p>

    <h3>Fancy Fibonacci</h3>
    <p>Use time-space tradeoff to accelerate running time of iFib(num) that returns numth number in theFibonacci sequence. Recall iFib(0)=0, iFib(1)=1, iFib(2)=1, iFib(3)=2.</p>

    <h3>Tricky Tribonacci</h3>
    <p>Why stop with Fibonacci? Create a function to retrieve a “Tribonacci” number, which we will define as the sum of the previous 3 values. Tribonaccis start with { 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81, ... }. Again, use a time-space tradeoff to make it fast.</p>

    <h3>Median of Sorted Arrays</h3>
    <p>Given two arrays that are sorted but not necessarily the same length, find the median value. Given ([1,5,9], [1,2,3,4,5,6]), return 4. If the number of values is even, return the average of the two middle values. Given ([1,5,9], [1,2,3,4,5]), return 3.5.</p>
    <p>Second: accept three arrays instead of two.</p>

    <h3>Time to English</h3>
    <p>You are given an integer representing the number of minutes that have elapsed since midnight. You should return a string  representing the current time, in the traditional spoken convention. Use numerals, except specifically the following words – midnight, noon, past, til, half, quarter. Examples: if given 30, return "half past midnight". If given 75, return "quarter past 1 am". If given 710, return "10 til noon". If given 1000, return "20 til 5 pm".</p>

    <h3>Missing Value</h3>
    <p>You are given an array of length N that contains, in no particular order, integers from 0 to N. One integer value is missing. Quickly determine and return the missing value. Given ([3,0,1]), return 2.</p>
    <p>Second: now the lowest value can now be any integer (including negatives), instead of always being 0. Given ([2,-4,0,-3,-2,1]) return -1. Given ([5,2,7,8,4,9,3]), return 6.</p>

    <h3>Rain Terraces</h3>
    <p>The Seattle Coding Dojo wants to send excess water to the Burbank Coding Dojo, so it landscapes its rooftop with a set of unusually elevated terraces. The terraces are all the same width but have varying heights. When it rains, water gathers in the low terraces that are surrounded by taller ones. For example, if we have terraces with heights [3,1,1,4,2], then as much as 4 units of water could be
        gathered, because water would pool 2-deep on two different terraces (both of the 1-high terraces: between the 3-high and 4-high terraces). Water on the other terraces just runs off the sides. Given an array of terrace heights, return the maximum amount of water that is trapped when rains come.</p>

    <h3>Last Digit of A to the B</h3>
    <p>Modern computers can handle very large numbers, but they do have their limits. A number that is repeatedly multiplied by itself will eventually exceed a computer’s ability to accurately represent it. (Note: the number of times it is multiplied by itself is called an exponent.) For an optional end-of-chapter challenge, determine the smallest (least significant) digit of a number that is potentially very, very large. You may find that you must do this without computing the actual (unimaginably large) number.</p>
    <p>Implement a function lastDigitAtoB(a,b) that accepts two non-negative integers. It should return the last digit of a number found by raising the first number (a) to an exponent of the second number (b). Examples: given (3,4), you should return 1 (3 * 3 * 3 * 3 is 81, whose last digit is 1). Given (12,5), return 2 (which is the least significant digit of 248832: 12 * 12 * 12 * 12 * 12). How high can you scale your solution? For example, what is the return value for (237,124)?</p>

    <h3>Matrix Search</h3>
    <p>Mike digs image recognition and wants to create a JavaScript Imaging Library, just like PIL for Python. He is given 2 different two-dimensional arrays, containing integers between 0 and 65535. Each two-dimensional array represents a gray-scale image, where each integer value is a pixel. The second image might be found somewhere within the larger one. Return whether it is.</p>
    <p>Second: Return location of first match found ([-1,-1] if no match). In example above, return [2,1].</p>

    <h3>Max of Subarray Sums</h3>
    <p>How efficient can you be in this following final challenge? The input may hold many million values.</p>
    <p>Given a numerical array that is potentially very long, return the maximum sum of values from a subarray. Any consecutive sequence of indices in the array is considered a subarray. Create a function that returns the highest sum possible from these subarrays. Given [1,2,-4,3,-2,3,-1], you should return 4 (for subarray [3,-2,3]), and given [-1,-2,-4,-3,-2,-3], return 0 (for []). This problem has many possible implementations. Which do you prefer & why?</p>
