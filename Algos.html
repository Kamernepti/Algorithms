    <h1>Testing Algorithms</h1>
    <h2><u>Fundamentals</u></h2>
    <h3>Setting and Swapping</h3>
    <p>Set myNum to 42. Set myName to your name. Now swap myNum and myName.</p>

    <h3>Print -52 to 1066</h3>
    <p>Print integers from -52 to 1066 using a FOR loop</p>

    <h3>Don't Worry, Be Happy</h3>
    <p>Create beCheerful(). Within it, console.log string "good morning!" Call it 98 times.</p>

    <h3>Multiples of Three- but Not All</h3>
    <p>Using a for loop, print multiples of 3 from -300 to 0. skip -3 and -6.</p>

    <h3>Printing Itegers with While</h3>
    <p>Print integers from 2000 to 5280, using a while loop</p>

    <h3>You Say It's Your Birthday</h3>
    <p>If 2 given numbers represent your birth month and day in either order, log "How did you know?", else log "Just another day..."</p>

    <h3>Print and Count</h3>
    <p>Print all integer multiples of 5, from 512 to 4096. afterwards, log how many there were. </p>

    <h3>Multiples of Six</h3>
    <p>Print multiples of 6 up to 60,000, using a While Loop</p>

    <h3>Counting, the Dojo Way</h3>
    <p>Print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, print "coding" instead. If by 10, also print "dojo"</p>

    <h3>What do you know?</h3>
    <p>Your function will be given an input parameter "incoming". console.log this value.</p>

    <h3>Whoa, That Sucker's Huge</h3>
    <p>Add odd integers from -300,000 to 300,000, and console.log the final sum. is there a shortcut?</p>

    <h3>Countdown by Fours</h3>
    <p>Log positive numbers starting at 2016, counting down by fours (exclude 0), witout a for loop.</p>

    <h3>Leap Year</h3>
    <p>Write a function that determines whether a given year is a leap year. If a year is divisible by four, it is a leap year, unless it is divisible by 100. However, if it is divisible by 400 then it is.</p>

    <h3>Flexible Counting</h3>
    <p>Based on the earlier "countdown by fours", given lowNum, highNum, mult, print multiples of mult from highNum dow to lowNum, using a for loop. </p>
    
    <h3>The Final Countdown</h3>
    <p>Based on flexible countdown. the parameter names are not as helpful, but the problem is identical. given 4 parameters(param1, param2, param3, param4), print multiples of param1, starting at param2 and extending to param3.
        one exception, if the multiples equal param4, then skip it. do this using a while loop.</p>

    <h3>Countdown</h3>
    <p>Create a function that accepts a number as an input. Return a new array that counts down by one, from
    the number (as array’s ‘zeroth’ element) down to 0 (as the last element). How long is this array?</p>
    
    <h3>Print and Return</h3>
    <p>Your function will receive an array with two numbers. Print the first value, and return the second.</p>
    
    <h3>First Plus Length</h3>
    <p>Given an array, return the sum of the first value in the array, plus the array’s length. What happens if the 
    array’s first value is not a number, but a string (like "what?") or a boolean (like false).</p>

    <h3>Values Greater than Second</h3>
    <p>For [1,3,5,7,9,13], print values that are greater than its 2nd value. Return how many values this is.</p>

    <h3>This Length That Value</h3>
    <p>Given two numbers, return array of length num1 with each value num2.  Print "Jinx!" if they are the same.</p>

    <h3>Fit the first value</h3>
    <p>the function should accept an array.  If value at [0] is greater than array's length, print "Too Big!".</p>
    <p>if value at [0] is less than array's length, print "too small!".  otherwise, print "Just right!"</p>

    <h3>Celsius to Fahrenheit </h3>
    <p>Create celsiusToFahrenheit (cDegrees) that accepts number of degrees Celsius, and returns the equivalent temperature expressed in Fahrenheit degrees.</p>


    <br>
    <h2><u>Basic Fundamentals</u></h2>
    <h3>Biggie Size</h3>
    <p>Given an array, write a function that changes all positive numbers in the array to “big”. Example: makeItBig([-1,3,5,-5]) returns that same array, changed to [-1,"big","big",-5].</p>

    <h3>Print Low, Return High</h3>
    <p>Create a function that takes an array of numbers. The function should print the lowest value in the array, and return the highest value in the array.</p>

    <h3>Print One, Return Another</h3>
    <p>Build a function that takes an array of numbers. The function should print the second-to-last value in the array, and return first odd value in the array.</p>

    <h3>Double Vision</h3>
    <p>Given an array, create a function to return a new array where each value in the original has been doubled. Calling double([1,2,3]) should return [2,4,6] without changing original.</p>

    <h3>Count Positives</h3>
    <p>Given an array of numbers, create a function to replace last value with the number of positive values. Example,  countPositives([-1,1,1,1]) changes array to [-1,1,1,3] and returns it.</p>

    <h3>Evens and Odds</h3>
    <p>Create a function that accepts an array. Every time that array has three odd values in a row, print "That’s odd!" Every time the array has three evens in a row, print "Even more so!"</p>

    <h3>Increment the Seconds</h3>
    <p>Given arr, add 1 to odd elements ([1], [3], etc.), console.log all values and return arr</p>

    <h3>Previous Lengths</h3>
    <p>You are passed an array containing strings. Working within that same array, replace each string with a number – the length of the string at previous array index – and return the array.</p>

    <h3>Add Seven to Most</h3>
    <p>Build a function that accepts an array. Return a new array with all values except first, adding 7 to each. Do not alter the original array.</p>
    
    <h3>Reverse Array</h3>
    <p>Given array, write a function to reverse values, in-place. Example: reverse([3,1,6,4,2]) returns same array, containing [2,4,6,1,3].</p>

    <h3>Outlook:Negative</h3>
    <p>Given an array, create and return a new one containing all the values of the provided array, made negative (not simply multiplied by -1). Given [1,-3,5], return [-1,-3,-5].</p>

    <h3>Always Hungary</h3>
    <p>Create a function that accepts an array, and prints "yummy" each time one of the values is equal to "food". If no array elements are
        "food", then print "I'm hungry" once.</p>

    <h3>Swap Toward the Center</h3>
    <p>Given array, swap first and last, third and third-tolast, etc. Input[true,42,"Ada",2,"pizza"] becomes ["pizza",42,"Ada",2,true]. 
        Change [1,2,3,4,5,6] to [6,2,4,3,5,1].</p>

    <h3>Scale the Array</h3>
    <p>Given array arr and number num, multiply each arr value by num, and return the changed arr.</p>

    <h3>Only Keep the Last Few</h3>
    <p>Stan learned something today: that directly decrementing an array’s .length immediately shortens it by that amount. Given array arr and number X, remove all except the last X elements, and return arr (changed and shorter). Given ([2,4,6,8,10],3), change the given array to [6,8,10] and return it.</p>

    <h3>Math Help</h3>
    <p>Cartman doesn’t really like math; he needs help. You are given two numbers – coefficients M and B in the equation Y = MX + B. Build a function to return the X-intercept (his older cousin Fiaz wisely reminds him that X-intercept is the value of X where Y equals zero; Cartman just snorts in his general direction).</p>

    <h3>Poor Kenny</h3>
    <p>Kenny tries to stay safe, but somehow everyday something happens. Out of the last 100 days, there were 10 days with volcanos, 15 others with tsunamis, 20 earthquakes, 25 blizzards and 30 meteors (for 100 days total). If these probabilities continue, write whatHappensToday() to print a day’s outcome.</p>

    <h3>What Really Happened?</h3>
    <p>Kyle (smarter than Kenny) notes that the chance of one disaster should be unrelated to the chance of another. Change whatHappensToday() function to create whatReallyHappensToday(). In this new function test for each disaster independently, instead of assuming exactly one disaster will happen. In other words, with this new function, all five might occur today – or none. Maybe Kenny will survive!</p>

    <h3>Soaring IQ</h3>
    <p>Your time at the Dojo will definitely make you smarter! Let’s say a new Dojo student, Bogdan entered with a modest IQ of 101. Let’s say that during a 14-week bootcamp, his IQ rose by .01 on the first day, then went up by an additional .02 on the second day, then up by .03 more on the third day, etc. all the way until increasing by .98 on his 98th day (the end of 14 full weeks). What is Bogdan’s final IQ?</p>

    <h3>Letter Grade</h3>
    <p>Mr. Cerise teaches high school math. Write a function that assigns and prints a letter grade, given an integer representing a score from 0 to 100? Those getting 90+ get an ‘A’, 80-89 earn ‘B’, 70-79 is a ‘C’, 60-69 should get a ‘D’, and lower than 60 receive ‘F’. For example, given 88, you should log "Score: 88. Grade: B". Given the score 61, log the string "Score: 61. Grade: D".</p>

    <h3>More Accurate Grades</h3>
    <p>For an additional challenge, add ‘-’ signs to scores in the bottom two percent of A, B, C and D scores, and “+” signs to the top two percent of B, C and D scores (sorry, Mr. Cerise never gives an A+). Given 88, console.log "Score: 88. Grade: B+". Given 61, log "Score: 61. Grade: D-" .</p>

    <br>
    <h2><u> Fundamentals II</u></h2>

    <h3>Sigma</h3>
    <p>Implement function sigma(num) that given a number, returns the sum of all positive integers up to number (inclusive). Ex.: sigma(3) = 6 (or 1 + 2 + 3); sigma(5) = 15 (or 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5).</p>

    <h3>Factorial</h3>
    <p>Just the Facts, ma’am. Factorials, that is. Write a function factorial(num) that, given a number, returns the product (multiplication) of all positive integers from 1 up to number (inclusive). 

        For example, factorial(3) = 6 (or 1 * 2 * 3); factorial(5) = 120 (or 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5).</p>

    <h3>Star Art</h3>
    <p>Assume that you have a text field that is exactly 75 characters long. You want to fill it with spaces and asterisks ('*'), sometimes called stars. You should print the given number of asterisks consecutively. Depending on which function is called, those stars should be left-justified (the first star would be very first char in the text field), or right-justified (the last star would be very last char in the text field, with potentially some number of spaces at beginning of text field before the block of stars start), or centered in the 75-
        character text field (with the same number of spaces on either side of the block of stars, plus/minus one).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Write a function drawLeftStars(num) that accepts a number and prints that many asterisks.</li>
            <li>Write a function drawRightStars(num) that prints 75 characters total. Stars should build from the right side. The last num characters should be asterisks; the other 75 should be spaces.</li>
            <li>Write function drawCenteredStars(num) that prints 75 characters total. The stars should be centered in the 75. The middle num characters should be asterisks; the rest of the 75 spaces.</li>
            <li> (Optional) Create epic text-art Empire vs. Rebellion battle scenes, with ships like (=*=)and >o<.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Character Art</h3>
    <p>From the above, derive the following that accepts and draws the given characters, not just asterisks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> drawLeftChars(num,char)</li>
            <li>drawRightChars(num,char)</li>
            <li>drawCenteredChars(num,char)</li>
            <li>For all three of these, you can safely assume that 'char'is a string with the length of 1.</li>
        </ul>
