    <h1>Testing Algorithms</h1>
    <h2><u> 1: Fundamentals (p.16)</u></h2>
    <p>1. Setting and Swappting- set myNum to 42. Set myName to your name. Now swap myNum and myName.</p>
    <p>2. Print -52 to 1066: print integers from -52 to 1066 using a FOR loop</p>
    <p>3. Don't Worry, Be Happy: Create beCheerful(). Within it, console.log string "good morning!" Call it 98 times.</p>
    <p>4. Multiples of Three- but Not All: Using a for loop, print multiples of 3 from -300 to 0. skip -3 and -6.</p>
    <p>5. Printing Itegers with While: Print integers from 2000 to 5280, using a while loop</p>
    <p>6. You Say It's Your Birthday: If 2 given numbers represent your birth month and day in either order, log "How did you know?", else log "Just another day..."</p>
    <p>7. Print and Count: Print all integer multiples of 5, from 512 to 4096. afterwards, log how many there were. </p>
    <p>8. Multiples of Six: Print multiples of 6 up to 60,000, using a While Loop</p>
    <p>9. Counting, the Dojo Way: print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, print "coding" instead. If by 10, also print "dojo"</p>
    <p>10. What do you know?: Your function will be given an input parameter "incoming". console.log this value.</p>
    <p>11. Whoa, That Sucker's Huge: add odd integers from -300,000 to 300,000, and console.log the final sum. is there a shortcut?</p>
    <p>12. Countdown by Fours: Log positive numbers starting at 2016, counting down by fours (exclude 0), witout a for loop.</p>
    <p>13. Leap Year: Write a function that determines whether a given year is a leap year. If a year is divisible by four, it is a leap year, unless it is divisible by 100. However, if it is divisible by 400 then it is.</p>
    <p>14. Flexible Counting: based on the earlier "countdown by fours", given lowNum, highNum, mult, print multiples of mult from highNum dow to lowNum, using a for loop. </p>
    <p>15. The Final Countdown: based on flexible countdown. the parameter names are not as helpful, but the problem is identical. given 4 parameters(param1, param2, param3, param4), print multiples of param1, starting at param2 and extending to param3.
        one exception, if the multiples equal param4, then skip it. do this using a while loop.</p>

    <h2><u>Chapter 1 Fundamentals (p. 20)</u></h2>
    <h3>Countdown</h3>
    <p>Create a function that accepts a number as an input. Return a new array that counts down by one, from
    the number (as array’s ‘zeroth’ element) down to 0 (as the last element). How long is this array?</p>
    
    <h3>Print and Return</h3>
    <p>Your function will receive an array with two numbers. Print the first value, and return the second.</p>
    
    <h3>First Plus Length</h3>
    <p>Given an array, return the sum of the first value in the array, plus the array’s length. What happens if the 
    array’s first value is not a number, but a string (like "what?") or a boolean (like false).</p>

    <h3>Values Greater than Second</h3>
    <p>For [1,3,5,7,9,13], print values that are greater than its 2nd value. Return how many values this is.</p>

    <h3>This Length That Value</h3>
    <p>Given two numbers, return array of length num1 with each value num2.  Print "Jinx!" if they are the same.</p>

    <h3>Fit the first value</h3>
    <p>the function should accept an array.  If value at [0] is greater than array's length, print "Too Big!".</p>
    <p>if value at [0] is less than array's length, print "too small!".  otherwise, print "Just right!"</p>

    <h3>Celsius to Fahrenheit </h3>
    <p>Create celsiusToFahrenheit (cDegrees) that accepts number of degrees Celsius, and returns the equivalent temperature expressed in Fahrenheit degrees.</p>


    <br>
    <h2><u>Basic Fundamentals</u></h2>
    <h3>Biggie Size</h3>
    <p>Given an array, write a function that changes all positive numbers in the array to “big”. Example: makeItBig([-1,3,5,-5]) returns that same array, changed to [-1,"big","big",-5].</p>

    <h3>Print Low, Return High</h3>
    <p>Create a function that takes an array of numbers. The function should print the lowest value in the array, and return the highest value in the array.</p>

    <h3>Print One, Return Another</h3>
    <p>Build a function that takes an array of numbers. The function should print the second-to-last value in the array, and return first odd value in the array.</p>

    <h3>Double Vision</h3>
    <p>Given an array, create a function to return a new array where each value in the original has been doubled. Calling double([1,2,3]) should return [2,4,6] without changing original.</p>

    <h3>Count Positives</h3>
    <p>Given an array of numbers, create a function to replace last value with the number of positive values. Example,  countPositives([-1,1,1,1]) changes array to [-1,1,1,3] and returns it.</p>

    <h3>Evens and Odds</h3>
    <p>Create a function that accepts an array. Every time that array has three odd values in a row, print "That’s odd!" Every time the array has three evens in a row, print "Even more so!"</p>

    <h3>Increment the Seconds</h3>
    <p>Given arr, add 1 to odd elements ([1], [3], etc.), console.log all values and return arr</p>

    <h3>Previous Lengths</h3>
    <p>You are passed an array containing strings. Working within that same array, replace each string with a number – the length of the string at previous array index – and return the array.</p>

    <h3>Add Seven to Most</h3>
    <p>Build a function that accepts an array. Return a new array with all values except first, adding 7 to each. Do not alter the original array.</p>
    
    <h3>Reverse Array</h3>
    <p>Given array, write a function to reverse values, in-place. Example: reverse([3,1,6,4,2]) returns same array, containing [2,4,6,1,3].</p>

    <h3>Outlook:Negative</h3>
    <p>Given an array, create and return a new one containing all the values of the provided array, made negative (not simply multiplied by -1). Given [1,-3,5], return [-1,-3,-5].</p>

    <h3>Always Hungary</h3>
    <p>Create a function that accepts an array, and prints "yummy" each time one of the values is equal to "food". If no array elements are
        "food", then print "I'm hungry" once.</p>

    <h3>Swap Toward the Center</h3>
    <p>Given array, swap first and last, third and third-tolast, etc. Input[true,42,"Ada",2,"pizza"] becomes ["pizza",42,"Ada",2,true]. 
        Change [1,2,3,4,5,6] to [6,2,4,3,5,1].</p>

    <h3>Scale the Array</h3>
    <p>Given array arr and number num, multiply each arr value by num, and return the changed arr.</p>
