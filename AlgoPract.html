    <h3>Countdown</h3>
    <p>Create a function that accepts a number as an input. Return a new array that counts down by one, from
    the number (as array’s ‘zeroth’ element) down to 0 (as the last element). How long is this array?</p>
    
        <h3>Print and Return</h3>
    <p>Your function will receive an array with two numbers. Print the first value, and return the second.</p>
    
    <h3>First Plus Length</h3>
    <p>Given an array, return the sum of the first value in the array, plus the array’s length. What happens if the 
    array’s first value is not a number, but a string (like "what?") or a boolean (like false).</p>

    <h3>Values Greater than Second</h3>
    <p>For [1,3,5,7,9,13], print values that are greater than its 2nd value. Return how many values this is.</p>

    <h3>This Length That Value</h3>
    <p>Given two numbers, return array of length num1 with each value num2.  Print "Jinx!" if they are the same.</p>

    <h3>Fit the first value</h3>
    <p>the function should accept an array.  If value at [0] is greater than array's length, print "Too Big!".</p>
    <p>if value at [0] is less than array's length, print "too small!".  otherwise, print "Just right!"</p>

    <h3>Celsius to Fahrenheit </h3>
    <p>Create celsiusToFahrenheit (cDegrees) that accepts number of degrees Celsius, and returns the equivalent temperature expressed in Fahrenheit degrees.</p>
